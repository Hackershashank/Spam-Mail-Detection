# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.  
It covers preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
